# Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

# A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

# Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

# Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = s.strip() # 删除首尾空格
        i = j = len(s) - 1
        res = []
        while i >= 0:
            while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ': i -= 1 # 搜索首个空格
            res.append(s[i + 1: j + 1]) # 添加单词
            while s[i] == ' ': i -= 1 # 跳过单词间空格
            j = i # j 指向下个单词的尾字符

        return ' '.join(res) # 拼接并返回
