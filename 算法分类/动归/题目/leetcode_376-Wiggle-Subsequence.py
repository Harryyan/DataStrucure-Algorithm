# A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. 
# The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two 
# non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

# For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
# In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive,
#  and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
# A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements 
# in their original order.

# Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
