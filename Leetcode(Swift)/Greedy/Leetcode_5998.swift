/*
 You are given an integer finalSum. Split it into a sum of a maximum number of unique positive even integers.
 
 For example, given finalSum = 12, the following splits are valid (unique positive even integers summing up to finalSum): (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8). Among them, (2 + 4 + 6) contains the maximum number of integers. Note that finalSum cannot be split into (2 + 2 + 4 + 4) as all the numbers should be unique.
 Return a list of integers that represent a valid split containing a maximum number of integers. If no valid split exists for finalSum, return an empty list. You may return the integers in any order.
